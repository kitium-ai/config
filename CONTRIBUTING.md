# Contributing to @kitiumai/config

Thanks for helping improve the KitiumAI config presets!

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
2. Build: `pnpm run build`
3. Type-check: `pnpm run typecheck` (if present) or rely on `pnpm run build`
4. Tests: `pnpm test`

## Standards

- Keep TypeScript strict and prefer explicit types.
- Run lint/format before opening a PR.
- Add or adjust tests when behavior changes.
- Update docs/CHANGELOG for user-facing changes.

## Reporting issues

Open an issue with reproduction steps, expected vs actual behavior, and environment details (Node version, OS, package version).
